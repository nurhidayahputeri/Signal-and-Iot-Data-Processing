Signal/Data Filtering Using LPF and MFA

1. Download dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/singlechestmounted-accelerometer
2. Please extract that dataset and choose one dataset out of 10 available dataset. You may use data format either in CSV or XLS / XLSX. Column A in dataset is index of data, you may select column B or C or D (X,Y, Z axis of accelerometer) as your raw data to be filtered.
3. Make a program, in Python or C or Matlab or Mathematica to perform signal / data filtering using:
   - LFP
   - MVP
4. Please answer the following questions.
   - Plot the raw data and compared to LPF and MVA Filter.
   - Which frequency cut-off (fc) do you use for LPF? How do you determine that fc ? (please provide a plot of filtered data regarding the frequency cutt-off you used)
   - What is the windows size you used in MVA ? (please select 3 different windows size, and then plot and compared the results). Which windows size does give smooth data plot? Why?
   - Please attach your listing program for LPF and MVA
